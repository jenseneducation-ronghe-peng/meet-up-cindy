Reflection:\
\
This is a really good course, I learned a lot from this course.\
TDD is the most beneficial part for me and I really love two projects we\'92ve done during the course, they provide opportunities for us to polish our test skills, as well as letting us to think about how to design a good app from another aspect. I also get the way to publish my own app. \
\
Thank you so much for this course.}
